Knuth's multiplicative hash
hash(v) = v * 2654435761 % 2^32
The seemingly arbitrary number is picked because it shares no common factors with 2^32. Called the golden ratio.

Locality-sensitive hashing
similar inputs have a higher probability of collision

Needs to be reversible. Could store only the difference between positions. Since we're aiming for human-readable names, exisiting hash functions would not take biologists' concerns into account.

Also, idea has been scratched. We should not try to encode information into names, however cool it may sound.
